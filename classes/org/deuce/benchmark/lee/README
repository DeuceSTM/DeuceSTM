LeeLockingSparse
-----------------
This tar file contains Lee's algorithm implemented using coarse-grain locking as described in [1]. It forms part of the Lee-TM benchmark package.


Lee-TM
------
All Lee-TM sources and input files are in src/. Source files are .java and input files are .txt. If you use Lee-TM please reference [1] and [2].


Running Lee-TM
--------------
In order to execute Lee-TM, run:

java -classpath build/classes:. LeeRouter <numthreads> <inputfile>

E.g. to run LeeRouter with the standard input file mainboard.txt, and using 8 threads, run:

java -classpath build/classes:. LeeRouter 8 src/mainboard.txt


NetBeans
--------
Netbeans build and project files are included. To use these simply open the project directory in netbeans.
